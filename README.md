# Project Repository for Learning Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD

This repository is dedicated to exploring containerization, orchestration, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. It includes the following key components:

- **Docker**: Containerize applications for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Manage containerized applications across multiple nodes for scalability and resilience.
- **CI/CD**: Automate testing, integration, and deployment processes to ensure fast, reliable code delivery.

### Goals:
- Develop a (somewhat)deep understanding of how to containerize applications with Docker.
- Learn to orchestrate and manage these containers using Kubernetes.
- Build efficient CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
- Gain hands-on experience with realworld tools and workflows to improve DevOps knowledge.
